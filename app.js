// Location sharing with Pure JavaScript and Maps Service

// A simple app where you can share location with your friend. In this project, you will use JavaScript to interact with external services for maps (ex. Google Maps or OpenStreetMap).

// Requirements:
// displaying your current location on a map
// "Share" button which creates a link with your current location
// a page which displays a location embedded in URL
// Nice to haves:
// sharing your realtime location, you will have to save it and read it every few seconds from an external database (ex. Firebase)
// displaying the realtime location of your friend when he accesses the page
