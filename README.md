#Test app created for the task:

Location sharing with Pure JavaScript and Maps Service

A simple app where you can share location with your friend. In this project, you will use JavaScript to interact with external services for maps (ex. Google Maps or OpenStreetMap).

Requirements:
displaying your current location on a map
"Share" button which creates a link with your current location
a page which displays a location embedded in URL
Nice to haves:
sharing your realtime location, you will have to save it and read it every few seconds from an external database (ex. Firebase)
displaying the realtime location of your friend when he accesses the page

'Nice to haves' might come when I learn how to use Firebase
